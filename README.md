# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The motivation to build this project was to create an application that can easily be used from the terminal so that the user can easily keep track of their employees and their information.

I learnt how to use node and how to build an application that you interact with via the terminal that also outputs a html file and creates cards which the user can then view in the browser. This is easily accessible and makes the information easy to read and understand for anyone.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use the application, open the repository files in VSCode and then open the terminal.
By using the command node index.js you are then able to run the application, and answer the various questions about the employees. Once you have finished answering the questions of the application, it will output the data into a html file which can then be viewed in the browser.
